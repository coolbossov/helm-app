# Code Review Guidelines

## Review guidelines

- Flag bugs, security issues, and performance bottlenecks
- Check for architecture and security regressions
- Flag hardcoded secrets, PII exposure, missing auth as P0
- Verify Supabase RLS covers new tables and columns
- Check Next.js patterns: prefer server components, avoid unnecessary client components
- Ensure API routes validate input and check authorization
- Suggest readability and maintainability improvements
- Keep feedback concise — focus on P0 and P1 issues
